## The Arc Of One Step

You press and hold shift to begin lifting the walker. Immediately you begin slowly to tip forward. The higher you raise it, the likelier it is that you'll fall over. When you let go of Shift, the walker begins to lower slowly.

As it lifts and falls, the Walker is subject to various forces, including the randomness of your weak and wobbling arms. You tap Q, A, E, & D to incrementally lift the corresponding corner, in an attempt to counteract these forces of fate, and land the Walker safely on the floor with all 4 contact points. There are various circumstances in which you do not successfully complete a landing, and fall to the ground.

Once your Walker is safely on the ground, you can begin shuffling forward by alternating the Feet buttons rapidly. You can shuffle forward as far as the Walker (possibly farther, starting it out off balance?) and then begin to lift again.

## The Bigger Picture

There's a mischievous orderly who comes and switches off the lights every night. When the lights go out, the action heats up for these thrill-seeking geriatrics. Nightly circuits of cut throat races through the barely-lit hallways.

In single-player mode, you're just trying to either (a) Get to the light switch, or (b) just get as far as you can. In a more-developed version, you might be racing against a group of AI characters, but not in the prototype. Weave your way around obstacles such as chairs, rugs, and the walkers of the fallen, as you go the distance.

In two-player split-screen VS. Mode, go elbow to boney elbow against a friend or nearly-departed frenemy as you race to the finish in fits and starts. Out-maneuver your foe, and leave them choking on your talcum-powder dust.

## We Need:
- A Good Hallway or Two
- Physics for moving.
- Models of Furniture/Obstacles
- Models of Arms
- Models of Walkers
- Possible 2-player split-screen
- Textures for all these things
- UI for the game menu
- Portraits For Character Select
- Other stuff I'm sure!

## Misc. Game Ideas:
In the Major Console Version with upgrades and progression:
- Lighter or heavier walkers? Walkers with other features?
- Style of Screws to hold it together?
- Crossbones & Toupees
