Game Design:

You are an elderly citizen, confined to retirement Facility.


## Controls


### Player 1
The Walker:  
Q - Raise Front Left Tennis Ball  
E - Raise Front Right Tennis Ball  
A - Raise Rear Left Stopper  
D - Raise Rear Right Stopper  
L Shift - Hold to lift the walker. Release to begin lowering the Walker.  

Your Feet:  
Z - Shuffle Left Foot Forward  
X - Shuffle Right Foot Forward


### Player 2
The Walker:  
U - Raise Front Left Tennis Ball  
O - Raise Front Right Tennis Ball  
J - Raise Rear Left Stopper  
L - Raise Rear Right Stopper  
R Shift - Hold to lift the walker. Release to begin lowering the Walker.  

Your Feet:  
M - Shuffle Left Foot Forward  
, - Shuffle Right Foot Forward


## The Arc Of One Step

You press and hold shift to begin lifting the walker. Immediately you begin slowly to tip forward. The higher you raise it, the likelier it is that you'll fall over. When you let go of Shift, the walker begins to lower slowly.

As it lifts and falls, the Walker is subject to various forces, including the randomness of your weak and wobbling arms. You tap Q, A, E, & D to incrementally lift the corresponding corner, in an attempt to counteract these forces of fate, and land the Walker safely on the floor with all 4 contact points. There are various circumstances in which you do not successfully complete a landing, and fall to the ground.

Once your Walker is safely on the ground, you can begin shuffling forward by alternating the Feet buttons rapidly. You can shuffle forward as far as the Walker (possibly farther, starting it out off balance?) and then begin to lift again.


## The Bigger Picture

There's a mischievous orderly who comes and switches off the lights every night. When the lights go out, the action heats up for these thrill-seeking geriatrics. Nightly circuits of cut throat races through the barely-lit hallways.

In single-player mode, you're just trying to either (a) Make it successfully through a series of levels, or (b) just get as far as you can in an endless(?) mode. In a more-developed version, you might be racing against a group of AI characters, but not in the prototype. Weave your way around obstacles such as chairs, rugs, and the walkers of the fallen, as you go the distance.

In two-player split-screen VS. Mode, go elbow to boney elbow against a friend or nearly-departed frenemy as you race to the finish in fits and starts. Out-maneuver your foe, and leave them choking on your talcum-powder dust.


## We Need:
- A Good Hallway or Two
- Physics for moving.
- Models of Furniture/Obstacles
- Models of Arms
- Models of Walkers
- Possible 2-player split-screen
- Textures for all these things
- UI for the game menu
- Portraits For Character Select
- Other stuff I'm sure!

## Gameplay:

### Turning ###

Turn slightly while planted, by shuffling the feet unevenly. Then when you lift, the Walker lifts and orients in front of you, but at an angle, so it's harder to compensate. You should also be able to turn a bit more while the Walker is Lifted, though I'm not quite sure about how to do that yet.

### Slam It ###

Should there be a key (maybe 2 or 9, above the adjustment keys?) to "Tetris Slam" the Walker down, if you're confident that it's aligned properly? This should probably introduce a small amount of variation while slamming, though not enough to make you feel like it's never worth it. Perhaps it just "amplifies" the direction it's currently oriented, so if you're a little askew to the left, it goes *more* to the left before it hits? And if you're moderately off-center when Slamming, it has a much greater risk of shooting out from underneath you and bringing you to the ground.

### Throw the Walker Aside? ###

- Maybe a button to "Let Go" of the Walker, which you might do when (1) Realize you're falling, and then to get the Walker out of the way for when you respawn, or to make it an obstacle for your opponent, you learn to try to chuck it out of the way, or (2) at the very end, perhaps you throw it away and just shuffle/topple forward over the finish line?

ALTERNATE 2P MODE:
2P is... The Walker. Fighting the player.
The walker is motivated by gravity and inertia. Just wants to stay still.
If the walker wins, it is incinerated in a victory fire for complicity in the crime.

ALTERNATE SUPER DIFFICULTY MODE:
The Perfect Dark 2-controller mode would be:
Double 4-prong cane, which is basically a smaller walker in each arm, there are two lift buttons, and you're doing two-handed lifting and balancing.

Hot Rod Walker should make a revving sound when it's in the air.
Exhaust pipe coming off it.
